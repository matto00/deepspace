# CLAUDE.md — DeepSpace

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## What this is

A procedurally generated space exploration game built in Unreal Engine 5.8,
emphasizing the scale of space: cruise, choose a destination, hyperjump, arrive.
The player lives aboard a ship they walk around inside and progressively upgrade.

Currently at **Milestone 1 — walk the ship**. See `docs/superpowers/plans/`.

The developer knows general game development but is new to Unreal and has no
art or modeling experience. **Explain Unreal-specific concepts rather than
assuming them.**

## Engine

Unreal Engine 5.8.2 lives at `~/UnrealEngine/UE_5.8`, outside this repo.

**Always launch via `unreal-editor`**, never the raw binary — the wrapper forces
XWayland, without which the editor renders blurry on the 4K display. See
`docs/decisions/0001-engine-and-toolchain.md`, which also records the several
places Epic's Linux documentation is wrong for the precompiled binary.

## Commands

```bash
./build.sh          # canonical compile check — run after EVERY C++ change
unreal-editor DeepSpace.uproject    # open the project

# Regenerate IDE project files (after moving files or adding modules)
~/UnrealEngine/UE_5.8/Engine/Build/BatchFiles/Linux/GenerateProjectFiles.sh \
    -project="$PWD/DeepSpace.uproject" -game -vscode
```

Automation tests run in the editor: **Tools → Session Frontend → Automation**,
filter `DeepSpace`.

## The rule that matters most

**All gameplay logic lives in C++. Blueprints only assign assets and expose
tunable values.**

Blueprints are binary `.uasset` files: not diffable, not mergeable, unreadable
to Claude. Logic placed there is invisible to both git history and to any AI
collaborator, and Blueprint-heavy projects are where hobby games hit performance
walls.

**Drift signal:** if gameplay logic starts appearing in `Content/`, the plan has
been abandoned. Say so.

## Architecture

- `Source/DeepSpace/Ship/ShipPowerState.*` — pure C++ power arithmetic, no
  Unreal types beyond containers. Headlessly unit-testable. The complexity sink.
- `Source/DeepSpace/Ship/ShipSubsystem.*` — `UWorldSubsystem` wrapping the above;
  authoritative ship state. Knows nothing about meshes, rooms, or the player.
- `Source/DeepSpace/Ship/InteractableComponent.*` — a component, deliberately
  not a class hierarchy, bolted onto anything interactable.
- `Source/DeepSpace/Player/DeepSpaceCharacter.*` — first-person pawn and the
  interaction trace.

Consumers **ask** the subsystem for state; they never store it. That discipline
is what keeps ship state from scattering across actors.

## Version control

`.uasset`/`.umap` go through **Git LFS** — configured before the first binary
asset existed. Never hand-edit them.

`Binaries/`, `Intermediate/`, `Saved/`, `.vscode/`, `Makefile`, and
`*.code-workspace` are generated and gitignored.

## Docs

- `docs/superpowers/specs/` — design docs (the why)
- `docs/superpowers/plans/` — implementation plans, updated in place as reality
  contradicts them
- `docs/decisions/` — short ADRs
